            Specific dates/times of each match is still to be determined. Each round lasts 1 week. If a team is unable to play their match during the specified time, they may reach out to the opposing team and find a time that works for both times. Any match reschedules
            must be reported to the Tournament Admin either via email or via Discord. The online playoffs are double elimination, so there is a separate schedule for the winners bracket and the losers bracket. You can see an example of a 64-team double
            elimination bracket <a href="https://battlefy.com/embeds/5918e7fdb9974b03414b3dfb/stage/5918e82e6d75c8033a3bd9ea?showFullscreen=true" target="_blank">here</a>. After you lose a match in the winners bracket, you move on to the losers
            bracket. You must lose 2 matches to be knocked out of the tournament.
